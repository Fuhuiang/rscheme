<h3>Looking at Running Threads</h3>
<p>The <span class="tc_stdin">,tl</span> REPL command shows the 
list of threads in the system.  This is a somewhat atypical listing
because the <b>main</b> thread is sleeping.  That's because
this test case is being run in a separate thread and the main
thread is in loop, thread-sleep'ing most of the time, and waiting 
for this test case's
thread to finish.</p>
