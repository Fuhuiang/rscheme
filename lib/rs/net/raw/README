This is the beginning of an implementation of an IP stack, using
Linux's TUN/TAP device (in TUN mode) to access raw packets.

It runs on Linux 2.6.12, and only understands ICMP ECHO-REQUEST
enough to generate a sensible reply (in other words you can ping
it!)

Start it up:

        $ rsf -q substring.scm tun_tap.scm gen.scm
        top[0]=>(g)

Note that /dev/net/tun must be rw by the user running rs,
but the user doesn't necessarily have to be root.

The device "tun0" will appear in the kernel (or some other tunX).  As
root, run ifconfig:

        ifconfig tun0 10.0.0.1 pointopoint 10.0.0.2 up

Then, you can ping the RScheme process:

        ping -c 1 -I tun0 10.0.0.2
