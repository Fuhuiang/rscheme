{chapter}Displays

{ch.front}
An X server, together with its screens and input devices, is
called a {defn/display/.  The &rx; display object encapsulates
all the information about an X server, its screens, and input
devices, as well as the state necessary to communicate with
the display over its connection.

Before an application can use a particular display, the application
must establish a connection to the X server managing the display.
One the connection has been established, the macros and functions
described in this chapter will return information about the
underlying X display.

This section describes how to:
{list}
  {item} Connect to (open) a particular display.
  {item} Get information about a display.
  {item} Manage the transmission of requests to a display's server.
  {item} Disconnect from (close) a display.
{/list}

{section}Connecting to a display

{vardefn type=class}<x-display>
{short}Represents the connection to a display of an X server.
{descr}
The {var/<x-display>/ class represents a connection to
a particular display of an X server.

A display object is created by the {var/open-display/ function.
{/vardefn}

{vardefn type=function}display?
{short}Test if an object is a display object
{fnsig}{fnsig.use}(display? {arg/object/)
       {fnsig.ret}{arg/bool/
{fnargs}
{fnarg}object
Any object.
{fnvals}
{fnval}bool
&t; if and only if {arg/object/ is an instance of {var/<x-display>.
&f; otherwise.
{descr}
Returns &t; or &f; according as whether
{arg/object/ is an X display object.
{/vardefn}

{vardefn type=function}open-display
{short}Connects to a display on particular X server.
{fnsig}{fnsig.use}(open-display {arg/host/ #key {arg/display/ {arg/protocol/)
       {fnsig.ret}{arg/display/
{fnargs}
{fnarg}host
{p}The name (a string) or IP address (an {var/<inet-addr>/) of
the host on which the X server is running.
{fnarg}display
{p}The integer id of the display to which to connect.
This is used because X allows a single server to support
multiple displays.  Defaults to 0.
{fnarg}protocol
{p}The protocol using which to connect.  Currently must be {symbol/tcp/.
{fnvals}
{fnval}display
{p}A {var/<x-display>/ object.
{descr}
{p}
Authorization, apart from server-side {code/xhost/ style,
is not currently supported.

Once connected to a display, all of its screens are
available to the application.
{/vardefn}

{section}Getting information about a display
{section}Managing server requests
{section}Disconnecting from a display

{vardefn type=function}close-display
{short}Disconnects from the given display.
{fnsig}{fnsig.use}(close-display {arg/display/)
{fnargs}
{fnarg}display
{p}An instance of {var/<x-display>/ to be closed.
{descr}
Closes the display's connection to the X server and
frees all local resources associated with the display.

Most operations on a closed display signal an error.

By default, all X server resources that are associated
with the client application will be destroyed when the
display is closed.  This can be overridden by changing
the close-down mode (see {var/set-close-down-mode!/).

Any buffered but unsent requests are discarded.
