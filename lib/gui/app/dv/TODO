* (2002-04-16)
  Better script support
  --> Edit script arguments
  --> Using favorite editor
        xterm -e vi /tmp/file
        emacs /tmp/file
  --> Explode

* (2002-04-16)
  Better X interaction
  --> Close-window processing
  --> Transient windows under Sawfish

* (2002-04-16)
  Better path handling
  --> Change point constraint (Alt-drag => unconstrained handle motion?)
  --> Show subpath selection (anchors, segments)
  --> Area-select subpaths
  --> Path join
  --> Path split
  --> Paths as script arguments
  --> Apply arrow script

* (2000-12-21)
  Improve selection flexibility
  --> The "handle id" is weak in expressing new kinds of
      selectability.  Even implementing path-point selection
      is nearly intractable.  Need some kind of transient abstract
      <selected-item> which makes up the selection set, and 
      references relevant graphic objects.
  --> The "generic-dragger" should work for transformations other
      than translation -- it should work for skew, rotate, etc.
  --> Handle multiple-object selection better
      * status view
      * drag everything together
      * select by area-drag (`completely-inside' or `some-inside' rule?)

* (2000-12-18)
  Add inspectors for system control
  --> Stroke style (width, color, join, ...)
  --> Fill style (color, complex fills, ...)
  --> Font style
  --> Page style
  --> Layers
  --> Style Dictionary
  --> Grid (spacing, color, stipple, origin in user units)
  --> Ruler (units, origin on paper, grid/user units?)
  --> Undo/Revert Memory, GC
  --> Object (position, size, ...)
  --> Transform (Rotate, Scale, Skew, ...)

* (2000-12-18)
  Add complex fills
  --> Gradient (linear/radial)
  --> "Set Gradient Vector" tool
  --> Pattern
  --> Tile
  --> PostScript (how to render?)

* (2000-12-18)
  Clip grid redraw to page outline

* (2000-12-18)
  Add rulers
  --> drag origin from ruler corner

* (2000-12-18)
  Add guide layer
  --> drag H/V guide from ruler

* (2000-12-18)
  Incorporate DESIGN and STYLES into doc/

* (2000-12-18)
  Integrate with RStep (gui.rstep.x) package
   --> replace <client> with <dv-application>;
       let RStep handle <client>

* (2000-12-09)
  Finish initial implentation of `script' object
   --> finish object/script.scm, with `insert-scripted' tool
   --> script palette
   --> script/envelope.scm
   --> macros/memorymap.scm
   --> macros/statediagram.scm

* (2000-12-05)
   Filter/plugin architecture and samples
   --> outline path
   --> trim path (cut at intersection)
       (analytic solution when parameters are exact?)

* (2000-12-05)
   XML (SVG) output format
   --> Export
   --> Backup-"save"

* (2000-12-05)
   Grouped objects
   --> Property changes apply throughout group
   --> Generic "explode"
       explode: box -> path
                circle -> path
                path -> subpaths
                text -> char...
                group -> element...
                char -> path
                line -> path

* (2000-12-05)
  Rotate/Scale tools

* (2000-12-05)
  "Magnetize" objects for object-based snap-to

* (2000-12-05)
  Fix dragging of some objects
  --> text has an offset
  --> rects, lines, groups, etc. should drag outlines
      (unless user clicks-and-hold, in which case draw to 
      offscreen buffer and composite on to drag)


* (2000-12-05)
  Support window-close from window manager
  --> on Minibuffer

* (2000-12-05)
  Filename completion in minibuffer
  --> emacs-like filename completion popup list, 
      where more TABs page through it (Some GUIs do part of this
      by putting the `in-doubt' text to the right of the insertion
      point, selected.  These semantics are consistent with type-to
      overwrite selection.)
  --> "Browse" filesystem option

* (2000-12-05)
  Text selection in minibuffer(s)

* (2000-12-05)
  Fix `find-bpp-and-pad' in gui.util.x

* (1998-10-28)
  Rework `current-geometry' to map from sheet coords to PAGE coords
  to avoid roundoff accumulation error.  This involves moving it up
  out of the driver, which is good anyway and can probably solve
  the redraw annoyance (also, we don't need to always recompute
  current-geometry -- just do it when dragging or clicking)

* (1998-05-25)
  Add text graphic objects
  -- partially done
  --> (2000-12-05) Select textually
  --> (2000-12-05) interactive commands for setting alignment, font, etc.

* (1998-05-25)
  Add polylines and bezier curves
  -- partially done
  --> (2000-12-05) Implement path join and scissor
  --> Implement corner/semismooth/smooth and point conversions
  --> Implement fill and stroke styles

* (1998-05-25)
  Load/Save/Undo
  -- partially done
  --> (2000-12-05) Implement Undo

* (1998-05-30)
  Factor out lightweight event management to be sharable
  by other applications (gui.app.framework.lightweight ?)

* (1998-05-30)
  Implement window resizing (that is, resize the window contents!)
  --> Note that RStep may do this for us...
  --> Find out what Robert's approach was.

* (1998-05-30)
  WM_NORMAL_HINTS for initial window placement from saved
  positions.

* (1998-05-30)
  Effective (instead of just introspective) scrollbars
  Scrollbar buttons
  --> Fix initial non-centered placement
  --> Fix divide-by-zero bug

* (1998-05-31)
  Support multiple displays; seperate out common frame concepts
  from document graphic view concepts.

* (1998-05-31)
  Implement an effective inspector, i.e., one that can modify
  the selected object.

* (1998-06-05)
  Add page functions `goto-page', `insert-page', `delete-page'

* (1998-06-05)
  Cut/copy/paste objects
    - graphic objects
    - pages
    - layers

* (1998-06-05)
  Add view-local variables like `point'

* (1998-06-05)
  Add `C-x o' (other-window) for circulating among app windows

* (1998-06-05)
  Add (frame) or (rect) interactive type

* (1998-06-05)
  Add dialog interpreter (generalization of minibuffer)
  -- partially done

* (1998-06-05)
  Add tabbed widget for inspectors etc.

* (1998-06-05)
  Add color to graphic objects
