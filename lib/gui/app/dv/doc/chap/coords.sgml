<chapter> <title>Coordinate Systems</title>

<para>
There are many different coordinate systems in play in a
given dV document.

<sect1><title>Coordinate System Math</title>
<para>
This section is a refresher on coordinate systems,
transforms, and composition.
<para>
The thing to remember is that <function>concatenate-transform</function>
operates in reverse.  That is, if transformation matrix P
converts from system A to B, and matrix Q converts from B to
C, then Q.P converts from A to C.

<equation>
        (point+ a b) = (transform a (translate Identity b))
</equation>

<equation>
        (transform (transform p A) B) = (transform p (concat B A))
</equation>

<sect1><title>User</title>
<para>
The user coordinate system is the PostScript page coordinate
system.  Its origin is the lower left of the page, and it
increases x to the right and y up.
<para>
User coordinates are the <emphasis>canonical</emphasis>
system for a given page.

<sect1><title>Device Sheet</title>
<para>
The device sheet coordinates are that of the
content X-window, except translated so that the origin
coincides with user coordinates.  In X coordinates, x
increases across and y down.

<para>
Device sheet coordinates are fixed for a given
view rotation and scale, because those are infrequently
changed (compared to translation, which changes by
scrolling the view). This allows points translated into
device sheet coordinates to be
cached for artwork and handles.

<para>
The view extent is obtained by adding an outset (negative
inset) of view-extent-margin to the page frame, transforming
that rectangle into device sheet coordinates, and taking the
bounding box of the transformed rectangle.

<sect1><title>Device</title>
<para>
Device coordinates are that of the content X-window.  Device
coordinates differ from device sheet coordinates only by a
translation which corresponds to the setting of the
scrollbars.

<para>
If the view extent is smaller in some dimension that the
content window, then the corresponding scrollbar is disabled
and the effect is one of centering.

<sect1><title>Object</title>
<para>
The object coordinate system is what the object's geometry itself uses
(after any general transformation applied to the object
itself, and certainly any transformation applied to parent groups).
Note that painting takes place in the user coordinate
system, so things like stroke widths are always measured in
user coordinates.

<para>
The <function>u-&gt;object-tm</function> procedure computes the
tranform matrix from user coordinates to object coorindates,
taking into account parent groups and any object-specific
general transformation.
